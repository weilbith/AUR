# PKGBUILD Collection

This is a small collection of diverse `PKGBUILD` files. They are used to build
packages that can be installed to _ArchLinux_. They are just not worth to get
published as an ArchLinux User Repository.

The goal is to have everything on your computer managed as either an package of
the OS or a plugin (if it is strongly related to a specific tool or
environment). The package for the OS is the always preferred approach if
possible.

Follow the instructions of the `README`s in the according directory
of a package to install it.

Note that some private packages also include source files. These are usually
just private bash scripts that get installed to `/usr/bin/` for convenience.
Although this might not be the cleanest design, it is simply too tortuous to
maintain them somewhere else.
